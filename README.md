# Basic-Recurrent-neural-network-
My first implementation of Rnn. I felt it a bit complex, there could be mistakes in this which i am unaware of.


Rnn is nothing but output of a previous neuron is the input for the next neuron.
This is the prediction of the google stock price for a particular month using the information avaiable for the previous 60 days.

The image shows the output . The graph gives an idea. The red line is the actual price and the blue line in the graph is the prediction of our model
